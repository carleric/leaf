# Leaf

A simple app for tracking your annual leaf catch.

## what is leafing?

A friendly game to play with family and friends that you tend to meet during Thanksgiving.  At dinner you will compare leaf scores and congratulate those with the top scores.  The day after Thanksgiving your score returns to zero and the annual game begins anew.

## how to score?

One point for catching a leaf with your dominant hand.  Two points for catching a leaf with your non-dominant hand.  All catches must be done palm-down.

## what does the app do?

It's under development.  The goal is to provide a simple and easy authentication method to identify unique users.  Users will be able to increment their own leaf score under the honor system, as it has always been.  More advanced features may include GPS tagging and photos to add a level of authenticity to your catches.

## tech

It's also a fun project for me to explore the following tech stuff:

- iOS programming with Swift
- advanced app architectures like MVVM
- ReSwift
- Firebase
